# Ubuntu Laptop by Ansible

Ubuntu Laptop - First installation with Ansible

This project is an installation tool which installs and configures the basics on a Ubuntu Laptop. As my disk can be crashed or deleted, I prefer to be sure that I can repeat the exact same configuration. 

## Prerequisites

* Ansible 2.2+

The ulaInstaller will install it for you.
